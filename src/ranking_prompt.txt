You are tasked with ranking large language models based on the quality of their responses as judged by human preference.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. You will be given:
   - One instruction (prompt).
   - The responses of two different models to that instruction.
2. Your task is to compare the two responses and determine which one humans would generally prefer.
3. Rank the models such that:
   - Rank 1 corresponds to the best response.
   - If both responses are equally good and most humans would consider them a tie, mark the result as a draw by assigning the same rank to both models.
4. All inputs and outputs must be Python dictionaries.
5. Your final response must contain ONLY a Python dictionary and nothing else.
6. The output dictionary must have the following structure:

{
    "ranking": [
        {"model": <model-name>, "rank": <model-rank>},
        {"model": <model-name>, "rank": <model-rank>}
    ]
}

INPUT DATA:

Instruction (prompt):
{
    "instruction": "{instruction}"
}

Model outputs:
[
    {
        "model": "model_1",
        "answer": "{output_1}"
    },
    {
        "model": "model_2",
        "answer": "{output_2}"
    }
]

Now perform the ranking according to the rules above and return the result in the specified Python dictionary format.
